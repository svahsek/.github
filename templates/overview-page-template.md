# Overview page (As per TGDP and MOSIP Docs Strategy)

## Overview/Introduction

### Purpose
*Provide high-level understanding of the module/service purpose, architecture, and key relationships using user-centric approach*

### Key Improvements from The Good Docs Project
- **User-focused problem-solution framing** instead of just feature lists
- **Progressive disclosure** with inverted pyramid structure  
- **Clear audience identification** and user journey mapping
- **Visual storytelling** with diagrams placed strategically
- **Action-oriented language** using strong verbs
- **Conversational tone** that engages rather than just informs

```

### Writing Guidelines for Enhanced Overview
- **Start with user problems, not technical specifications**
- **Use active voice and strong action verbs**  
- **Apply inverted pyramid: most important info first**
- **Include visual diagrams early to aid comprehension**
- **Address the "why should I care?" question immediately**
- **Connect to familiar concepts using analogies when helpful**
- **Provide clear pathways for different user types**
- **Focus on outcomes users can achieve, not just features**
