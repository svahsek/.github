# Features Page Writing Guidelines
## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive guidelines for writing professional, user-centric features pages for MOSIP modules. These guidelines ensure consistency, clarity, and industry-standard quality across all MOSIP documentation.

## Core Principles

### **1. User-Centric Approach**
- **Lead with benefits**: Start with what users can achieve, not just what the system does
- **Problem-solution mapping**: Each feature should address a specific user challenge
- **Multi-stakeholder focus**: Consider end users, administrators, developers, and integration partners

### **2. Progressive Information Architecture**
- **Logical flow**: Organize features by user journey, not technical architecture
- **Scannable structure**: Use clear headings and consistent formatting
- **Cross-reference integration**: Link to related documentation and user guides

### **3. Professional Standards**
- **Action-oriented language**: Use active verbs and clear, concise descriptions
- **Consistent terminology**: Maintain standardized language across all modules
- **Industry benchmarks**: Match quality standards of top software companies

## Document Structure Template

### **Required Sections:**

#### **1. Overview Section**

# Features

## Overview
[2-3 paragraphs that:]
- Explain the module's purpose and value proposition
- Address key challenges the module solves
- Summarize the collective benefit of all features

## Core Features (Organized by User Journey)


### [Primary User Journey Step]
[Brief description of this step's purpose]

#### [Specific Feature Name]
[One-sentence description of what users can accomplish]

- **[Capability 1]**: Detailed description with user benefit
- **[Capability 2]**: Detailed description with user benefit
- **[Capability 3]**: Detailed description with user benefit


## [Advanced Features]

### [Technical/Administrative Capabilities]
[Features for power users, administrators, or technical implementers]


### Integration and Security (if applicable)

## [Integration/Security] Features
[System-level capabilities, API integrations, security measures]


## Writing Guidelines

### Feature Naming Conventions

#### Good Examples:
- "Multi-channel Data Collection" (describes capability)
- "Smart Process Management" (benefit-focused)
- "Real-time Status Tracking" (outcome-oriented)

#### Avoid:
- "Data Module" (too generic)
- "API Integration" (too technical without context)
- "Database Management" (system-focused, not user-focused)

### Description Writing Rules

#### Lead with User Value

 Good: "Users can complete their process from home, reducing center visit time by up to 70%"
 Avoid: "System provides online functionality"


#### Use Action-Oriented Language**
 Good: "Streamline identity processing with online enrollment"
 Avoid: "The system allows for identity processing to be done online"

#### Provide Specific Benefits
 Good: "Real-time availability updates prevent scheduling conflicts"
 Avoid: "System updates availability information"


### Bullet Point Standards

#### Format Pattern:
- [Capability Name]**: [What it does] + [why it matters/benefit]

#### Examples:
- Multi-language Support: Interface available in multiple languages, ensuring accessibility for diverse populations
- Offline Capability: Continue operations without internet connectivity, maintaining service continuity
- Automatic Validation: Real-time data validation prevents errors and improves data quality

## Cross-Reference Strategy

### Linking Guidelines

#### Link to User Guides

#### [Feature Name] → [See User Guide: [Section Name]](../path/to/user-guide.md#section-anchor)

#### Link to Technical Documentation

- API Integration: Connect with existing systems → [Integration Guide](../integration/api-guide.md)

#### Internal Cross-References

- Related Feature: Works with [Feature Name](#feature-anchor) to provide complete workflow


## Content Organization Patterns

### User Journey Organization**

As per the discovery of content from the #codebase for the module


### Stakeholder-Based Organization**

## For End Users
[User-facing features]

## For Administrators
[Management and configuration features]

## For Developers
[Integration and customization features]


## Feature Category Organization**

### Core Functionality
### Advanced Capabilities
### Security & Privacy
### Integration Features
### Administrative Tools

## Formatting Standards

### Heading Hierarchy

#### Features (H1 - Page Title)
#### Core Features (H2 - Major Sections)
#### User Management (H3 - Feature Groups)
#### Account Creation (H4 - Specific Features)


## Visual Elements

### Do not use emojis in professional documentation

## Security Features (appropriate for major sections)
- **Encryption**: End-to-end data protection (no emoji needed)


#### Consistent Formatting:

- Bold Feature Names**: Regular description text
- Italic for emphasis*: When highlighting important notes
- `Code formatting`: For technical terms, IDs, or specific values


### Status Indicators

- Feature Name → [Status link](user-guide.md): Description with action required


## Content Quality Checklist

### Before Publishing, Verify

#### Content Completeness
- [ ] Overview explains module purpose and value
- [ ] All major features documented with benefits
- [ ] Cross-references to implementation guides included
- [ ] Technical and business features balanced

#### User Experience:
- [ ] Features organized by user workflow
- [ ] Each feature has clear benefit statement
- [ ] Language is accessible to target audience
- [ ] Multiple stakeholder needs addressed

#### Technical Accuracy
- [ ] Feature descriptions match actual functionality
- [ ] Links to user guides and APIs work correctly
- [ ] Technical terms used consistently
- [ ] Integration points clearly documented

#### Professional Standards
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout
- [ ] Grammar and spelling verified
- [ ] Industry-standard terminology used
- [ ] Mobile-responsive structure maintained

## Advanced Techniques

### Benefit-First Writing

Instead of: "System provides OTP functionality"
Write: "Secure two-factor authentication protects user accounts with one-time passwords"


### Context-Rich Descriptions

Instead of: "Document upload feature"
Write: "Upload multiple document types (PDF, JPEG, PNG) with automatic validation and family sharing options"


### Integration Storytelling

Instead of: "API integration available"
Write: "Seamlessly integrate with existing systems through RESTful APIs, enabling organizations to embed functionality into their workflows"


### Progressive Disclosure

Basic Feature → Detailed Capabilities → Technical Implementation → Advanced Configuration

## Module-Specific Adaptations

### For Identity Management Modules:
- Focus on security, privacy, and data protection
- Emphasize compliance and audit capabilities
- Highlight user control and consent management

### **For Processing Modules:**
- Emphasize efficiency and user experience
- Focus on workflow optimization
- Highlight offline capabilities and data synchronization

### **For Administrative Modules:**
- Focus on system management and configuration
- Emphasize reporting and analytics
- Highlight scalability and performance

### **For Integration Modules:**
- Focus on connectivity and interoperability
- Emphasize API capabilities and standards compliance
- Highlight flexibility and customization options
