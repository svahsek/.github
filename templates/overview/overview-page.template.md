### Advanced: Creating Custom Plugins

For advanced users, you can develop your own plugins by implementing the `{PLUGIN_INTERFACE_NAME}` interface:

```{LANGUAGE}
{PLUGIN_INTERFACE_CODE_SNIPPET}
```

* **Reference Implementation:** [{REFERENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_NAME}]({REFERENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_LINK})
* Once a custom plugin has been developed refer to this [document]({CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DEPLOYMENT_LINK}) to deploy the plugin.

## Deployment

{PRODUCT_NAME} supports two modes of deployment to cater to different users with different purposes:

1.  **Local Development Setup**

    * Intended for experimentation and user experience. Local Setup can be carried out in two ways:
        * **Local Setup with Docker Compose**
            * Recommended for users who want to experience the product from a technical/backend perspective.
            * Refer to [this guide]({DOCKER_COMPOSE_SETUP_LINK}) to try this mode of setup.
        * **Local Setup without Docker Compose**
            * Recommended for developers or community contributors who want to perform debugging or gain a deeper understanding of the {PRODUCT_NAME} codebase.
            * Refer to [this guide]({LOCAL_DEV_SETUP_LINK}) to try this mode of setup.
    * This is for developers, community members, and country representatives to explore the application, demonstrate its usage to external stakeholders, or conduct proof-of-concepts (POCs).

2.  **Deployment with Kubernetes cluster**

    * Designed for production environments.
    * Enables users to host and utilize the product at scale.
