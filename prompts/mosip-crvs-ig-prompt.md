# MOSIP-CRVS Documentation - Improvement

# Notes: 

- Hyperlink to MOSIP content wherever it can be done
- Scope topic - Some steps Rachik may have written may be inconsistent, identify if these are sufficient or may need more of steps. (Kind of templatize it)
  - Can we also not bring the API documentation together with scope topic?
- Integration Limitation - is there, can be better worded






Refer to the attached document for detailed steps on improving the MOSIP-CRVS integration documentation.
I have to make MOSIP-CRVS Integration content lucid and comprehensive and do away with ambiguity.
I hosted a google meet cal with the SME and Product owner Rachik to get clarity on the existing content and what needs to be improved.
Here is the attached transcript of the meeting for reference
Also here is the note taken from the transcript which the google meet transcriber automatically took from the meeting.
Having gone through this enlist the key points that needs to be said upfront which removed ambiguity.

You know that the MOSIP-CRVS documentation is already here
However the feedback from the stakeholder says the https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/interoperability/integrations/mosip-crvs is ambiguaos and not comprehensive enough
Although the other parts which is technical details as well as API etc may be fine 
Therefore, we met and discussed this with Rachik and here is the transcript in the attached file
Also consider the docs/interoperability/integrations/mosip-crvs/existing-integrations/_raw-transcript-note.md file which has some notes extracted
Can you identify the key points from this transcript which needs to be said upfront in the documentation to remove ambiguity and make it more comprehensive
