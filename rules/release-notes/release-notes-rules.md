## RULE CATEGORIES & SEVERITY LEVELS

## VALIDATION WORKFLOW

When validating a release note, check rules in this order:

1. **Structural** (RULE-001, 002, 003): Does it have proper format?
2. **Content** (RULE-004 through 013): Does content meet quality standards?
3. **Polish** (RULE-009, 010): Is it well-written?

**Output Format for Violations**:
```
❌ RULE-005: No Placeholder Text
   Severity: ERROR
   Found: "TBD - more features coming"
   Location: Line 12, under "Enhancements"
   Fix: Replace with actual content or remove section
```

## How to Use This File with an AI Agent

**Instructions for validation AI**:
1. Parse the entire release note
2. For each RULE (001-013), check if the condition passes
3. Report all ERRORS first (blocks release)
4. Report WARNINGS (quality issues)
5. Provide specific line numbers and suggestions
